Advanced RAG Techniques

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has evolved significantly with several advanced techniques:

1. Parent Document Retrieval
Parent document retrieval is a technique where smaller chunks are used for retrieval but larger parent documents are returned for context. This approach helps maintain semantic coherence while enabling precise retrieval.

2. Multi-Query Retrieval
Multi-query retrieval generates multiple variations of the user's query to capture different aspects and improve retrieval coverage. This technique helps overcome the limitations of single-query approaches.

3. Contextual Compression
Contextual compression reduces noise in retrieved documents by filtering out irrelevant information while preserving the most relevant content for the generation phase.

4. Entity Memory
Entity memory systems track important entities mentioned in conversations, allowing for better context awareness and more coherent multi-turn interactions.

5. Hybrid Search
Hybrid search combines dense vector search with sparse keyword search to leverage the strengths of both approaches for improved retrieval accuracy.

6. Re-ranking
Re-ranking techniques use additional models to reorder retrieved documents based on relevance to the query, improving the quality of context provided to the generator.

These techniques can be combined to create sophisticated RAG systems that significantly outperform basic implementations.
